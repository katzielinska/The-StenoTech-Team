        <p id="text"> Although Steno Museum’s dental clinic looks like an old-fashioned cozy living room, with dark striped wallpaper, carpet and dark brown leather furniture, it is a dental clinic, as it could look in the early 20th century, with treadmill, salivary nozzle without drainage and X-ray which not only irradiated the patient, but also the dentist.<br> <br> 
        It’s far from the fast, water-cooled drills and the comfortable patient chair with good dentist working position of today.
